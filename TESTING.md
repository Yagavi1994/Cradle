## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

During development, several bugs were encountered and resolved:

## Fixed Bugs

### Categories Dropdown Flickering

- **Issue**: The categories dropdown list was flickering when users hovered over it. This issue was caused by an overlapping background animation, leading to a poor user experience.

- **Fix**: To resolve the issue, I replaced the bootstrap dropdown list with the Choices.js plugin, which provides a more stable and user-friendly dropdown interface. The plugin eliminated the flickering and improved the performance and visual consistency of the categories dropdown.

### Database Migration Issue

- **Issue**: Database migrations failed due to a conflict in the field types.
- **Fix**: Corrected field types in `models.py` and re-ran migrations, which resolved the conflicts and allowed migrations to complete successfully.

### Profile Picture Upload

- **Issue**: Uploaded profile pictures which were not square were displaying in ovals and not circle.
- **Fix**: Adjusted Cloudinary image upload settings to make sure image dimension is square in the image link which ensured the images uploaded with different dimension remains circle.

### Post Pagination

- **Issue**: Pagination buttons were incorrectly displayed when there were fewer than 5 posts.
- **Fix**: Added conditional rendering logic to only display pagination controls when necessary.

### Form Validation

- **Issue**: Form validation errors were not displaying inline as expected.
- **Fix**: Corrected the validation logic to ensure errors are displayed inline, enhancing the user experience.

### CSS Alignment

- **Issue**: Elements on the Comment box in post-detail page were misaligned on specific screen sizes.
- **Fix**: Adjusted CSS to ensure proper element alignment across all devices.

### JavaScript Functions Not Working in `scripts.js`

- **Issue**: JavaScript functions were not functioning correctly when all scripts were written together in the `scripts.js` file. This caused conflicts and performance issues across different features.

- **Fix**: To resolve the issue, the functions were separated into individual JavaScript files, each dedicated to a specific feature. By modularizing the code into separate files, the bugs were fixed, and the functionality of each feature was restored, ensuring smooth performance across the site.

### CSRF Token Failure on Mobile Login

**Issue**: While attempting to log in via a mobile device, users encountered a "CSRF token failed" error. This was due to the deployed link not being included in the CSRF trusted origins list.

**Fix**: The fix was to add the actual deployed site URL in the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting instead of the Heroku link, which resolved the issue and allowed successful logins from mobile devices.
